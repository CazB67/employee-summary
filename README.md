The task was to build a software engineering team generator command line application. The application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This application also needed to pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

3. Call the `render` function and pass in employees array.
4. Create `output` folder.
5. Using the HTML returned, write it to a file named `team.html` in the `output` folder. 
6. Run tests
7. Add CSS

## Usage
To use this application run the following in the command line:

```
node app.js
```
The user is then prompted with a series of questions like so.

To run tests, run the following command:

```
## Bugs
There is an asynchronous issue with github validation I think. After a new engineer has been added. The app gets stuck on the next employee's name. The problem is resolved by pressing enter but I would rather it not be there.
