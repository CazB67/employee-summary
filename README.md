The task was to build a software engineering team generator command line application. The application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This assignment must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. Following the common templates for user stories, we can frame this challenge as follows:
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
